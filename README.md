# Sign-language-recognition-with-TensorFlow
In this project, we will build an algorithm using the Deep learning framework "TensorFlow" to recognize the numbers from 0 to 5 created with our finders, 
and so we want here to facilitate the communication between a speech_impered person and someone who doesn't understand sign language
